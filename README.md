Welcome to ARiot!

In this project, we visually enhance and upgrade interactivity of sensors and iot devices with augmented reality.

lambdasFunctions/
contains aws lambdas functions that act as API endpoints connecting our edge devices, mongo database, and iOS app.

ios/

It was originally inspired by https://github.com/dparksports/aruco-arkit-opencv.
